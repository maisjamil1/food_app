## Food APP 
- Feel free to explore my app using this link: https://food-app-flax-one.vercel.app/

- I really enjoyed working on this project. For the first time, I tried using Chadcn (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs). What's impressive about Chadcn is that it's  a collection of reusable components that seamlessly integrate into your applications. It is very helpful, especially for adding a dark mode feature, and I plan to use it more in the future.

- Additionally, I utilized TanStack Query (https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for handling API requests. It's remarkably powerful for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating state.

- I wished I could have used Storybook (https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/why-storybook) in this project. It would have been great for testing and writing down details about each component and for building a design system.

- Note : I ran into a problem because the API only allows 150 requests per key.Hopefully, the deployed version will work without problems. If it doesn't, I have attached a video demo for reference.
